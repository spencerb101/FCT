# Factom Explorer

The Factom blockchain comprises of more than 77,000 blocks, at the time of writing. While the majority of the block lookups are done via APIs, the Explorer allows viewers to peruse data manually. The Factom Explorer provides information about the Factom blockchain including Factoid and Entry Credit addresses, blocks, entries, time stamps, transaction IDs and more.

Exploring Factom blocks manually via the Factom Explorer can be very insightful and informative for users looking to understand Factom’s data structure design. Furthermore, it provides important information such as FCT or EC balance visually, without having to run our software. The Factom Explorer is accessible at [https://explorer.factom.com](https://explorer.factom.com).

### Overview <a id="overview"></a>

The Explorer has two tabs, “Explorer” and “Chains.” The “Explorer” tab displays details of the Factom Data Structures including the Directory Blocks with their IDs and block times, KeyMRs, Admin Entries, EC Entries, Factoid Entries, and user-generated Entries.

![Explorer 1](https://docs.factom.com/images/wallet_095.png)

The “Chains” tab displays details all the Factom chains with their ChainIDs and Chain Names.

**ChainID**

The ChainID is created by hashing the name of a Factom Chain. ChainID’s are used in the Directory Block, and anywhere else in the protocol that must refer to a Factom Chain.

**Chain Names**

Chain Names are generated by the user to uniquely identify a Chain. They can be random numbers, a string of text, a public key, or a hash of some private directory path.

The Chain Name can be specified with multiple sequential byte strings. A [byte string](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6224052/what-is-the-difference-between-a-string-and-a-byte-string) is similar to a string \(a series of characters\) – but its content is a sequence of bytes instead of characters. They are treated as different segments of data instead of concatenated, to differentiate trailing bytes of one segment from leading bytes of the next segment.

### Directory Block <a id="directory-block"></a>

Factom is constructed of a hierarchical set of blocks, with the highest being Directory Blocks, each of which consists of a header and a body. Each Directory Block has a header for unique identification and contains hashes of the Entry Blocks and their respective ChainIDs for entries made during the time period. To link this data together, each Directory Block contains the serial hash of the previous Directory Block. The body of the Directory Block is a series of pairs of ChainIDs and Entry Block Merkle Roots.

The example below displays [Directory Block ID 75416](http://explorer.factom.org/dblock/49336542108f65f24bd4d4044b7558181d439ed9505ad61eff653c586eeb3cda). Note that factomd had not anchored this block on the Bitcoin blockchain at the time of writing.

![Explorer 3](https://docs.factom.com/images/wallet_097.png)

In the example below [Directory Block ID 70405](http://explorer.factom.org/dblock/2c6c6247ae2602a08d5b59850682a60228bbc23ae66c67916836b684fc8daea9) shows that factomd has anchored the block on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Click on the “[BTC Transaction](https://blockchain.info/tx/83ea4629b0e5d7ae7ee313d377dc4f9cb258652c76937afce4d0be29add6d8a3)” and the “[Anchor entry](http://explorer.factom.org/entry/e47fe17ea16474444d3895d6048b2ade4c71114f9742d31a6e1d7d035019e2ee)” to get further information.

![Explorer 4](https://docs.factom.com/images/wallet_098.png)  
Note about timestamps: Unlike Bitcoin, timestamps in Factom record the opening of a block rather than the closing. The lower level blocks \(not Directory Blocks\) have minute markers to indicate the number of minutes after opening that each Entry was seen.

Within each Directory Block is an Admin Block, an Entry Credit Block, a Factoid Block, and several Entry Blocks. These Factom data structures include different information and are described below.

![Explorer 5](https://docs.factom.com/images/wallet_099.png)

### Admin Block <a id="admin-block"></a>

The Admin Block contains the signatures and organizational data needed to validate previous and future Directory Blocks. It has a LookupHash, in this case:

[69f4bebe76d94054f4bdb0cf56a47cafacae60ce6be76885ecd60252463a6e8e](http://explorer.factom.org/ablock/69f4bebe76d94054f4bdb0cf56a47cafacae60ce6be76885ecd60252463a6e8e)

This is a SHA256 of the entire block. Clicking it displays the Admin Block itself which contains:

* Partial Hash and Full Hash represent the “BackReferenceHash” or LookupHash.
* This particular example includes five entries
* The Previous Block hash is also included
* The Raw binary is the fully serialized admin block
* The JSON Data

The JSON Data includes the references to the previous block such as:

* The Previous Block Back Reference Hash: _\“PrevBackRefHash\”:\“53ae4325e045d48f4f786ef9be6065da68c7aa8f149b781d57c2c3ea52fc8c5f\”_
* The current Directory Block Height: _\“DBHeight\”:75416_
* And more info about the current block such as size, entries, messages, etc

The LookupHash for the current Admin Block, 75416, will be included in the next created Admin Block as the Previous Block Back Reference \(PrevBackRefHash\) shortly \(in about 10 minutes\) where it gets referenced. The next Admin Block will also include the same type of data; this creates the Factom Blockchain composed of consecutive blocks with references to previous blocks.

![Explorer 6](https://docs.factom.com/images/wallet_100.png)  
You can reference each Admin Block in two ways:   
  
1. By the Directory Block  
2. By the next Admin Block   
  
Keeping the Admin Blocks secure is critical to the integrity of the Factom Blockchain. However, since there aren’t any Key Merkle Roots and the blocks use straight hashing rather than a slower function that would make brute force attacks more difficult, we had to get creative.   
  
We decided to have two hashes of each Admin Block, both with 256 bits.

* **Hash 1:** A SHA256 hash of the block.
* **Hash 2:** A SHA512 hash of the previous Admin Block in which we only take the top 256 Bits.

This way, if someone wanted to fake an Admin Block while having the hashes match, they would need to break both a SHA256 and a SHA512 at the same time for the same fake data. Eat that, hackers!

The five entries included in this [Admin Block](http://explorer.factom.org/ablock/69f4bebe76d94054f4bdb0cf56a47cafacae60ce6be76885ecd60252463a6e8e) present more information.

![Explorer 7](https://docs.factom.com/images/wallet_101.png)

Clicking on [any of the entries](http://explorer.factom.org/entry/21d21a9632b9715b607c96fddf9f56bc9f77f7e0839b8c218e0c69ae82272415) shows further data such as the Hash, ChainID, Timestamp, Entry Data and JSON Data.

![Explorer 8](https://docs.factom.com/images/wallet_102.png)

An Entry is a single data submission made by a user. A collection of entries makes up a Factom Chain. There are certain bookkeeping entries required, but there are no restrictions on the content of an Entry. An Entry is restricted to no more than 10K in size and requires an Entry Credit for every 1K of data. Entry size is so restricted to ensure reasonably fast propagation of Entries through the network, as required by the consensus algorithm. The user can string together multiple entries for larger content.

### Entry Credit Block <a id="entry-credit-block"></a>

An Entry Credit \(EC\) Block is a data structure which packages Chain Commits, Entry Commits, and EC balance increases over a ten-minute period. The Entries are ordered in the Entry Block in the order that they were received by each Federated server. All the Federated servers contribute to the building of the EC Block.

The [Entry Credit Block](http://explorer.factom.org/ecblock/b3633e936305288392e322dbfc406537647a2c6119d313aac8673c34ff2ea8c5) consists of a header and a body. The body is composed of primarily commits and balance increases with minute markers and server markers distributed throughout the body.

![Explorer 9](https://docs.factom.com/images/wallet_103.png)

The JSON Data is also shown.

![Explorer 10](https://docs.factom.com/images/wallet_104.png)

This particular block contains 57 Entries.

![Explorer 11](https://docs.factom.com/images/wallet_105.png)

### Factoid Block <a id="factoid-block"></a>

[Factoid Blocks](http://explorer.factom.org/fblock/3f150e28e6fdde47a707d2a3e5df3236dcad05df0a088e0edfa36e8cdb4f9607) package Factoid transactions that take place each minute over a ten-minute period. Factoid transactions and their minute markers are arranged in the order in which they were received by the Federated server. Factoid transactions begin with a version number above zero, differentiating them from other types of transactions, and minute markers are included in the ledger Merkle roots.

![Explorer 12](https://docs.factom.com/images/wallet_106.png)

In the below list of entries, FCT transactions may be identified by looking at the Totalins and Totalouts.

![Explorer 13](https://docs.factom.com/images/wallet_107.png)

Selecting the [second entry](http://explorer.factom.org/tx/04b5292074368df8f971f1792e96c0de511ee1a23e6185daa2f8d0ee35c3d79b), more information is displayed about the FCT transaction such as the Tx ID, Timestamp, the Block Height, as well as its FCT Inputs and Outputs.

![Explorer 14](https://docs.factom.com/images/wallet_108.png)

### Entry Block <a id="entry-block"></a>

[Entry Blocks](http://explorer.factom.org/eblock/a66d2c6b9bf118baaca96016e6fd03d52c0fc2a2332e001be32286805a8ef8fb) package Entry Hashes of all entries for a particular Factom Chain received over a ten-minute period, arranged in the order in which they were received by the Federated server.

After each ten-minute period, the Merkle Roots for each Entry Block are stored in the Directory Block. Entry Blocks contain Entry Hashes with ten one-minute markers.

![Explorer 15](https://docs.factom.com/images/wallet_109.png)

Entry Data can be viewed by selecting [an entry](http://explorer.factom.org/entry/c9bd61c180ecdcccc39be2af1c1f40a540b20ecb2b1c78960eed8ff6fbf1c6f7) in this Entry Block.

![Explorer 19](https://docs.factom.com/images/wallet_113.png)

### Search for FCT/EC addresses <a id="search-for-fct-ec-addresses"></a>

To use Explorer to verify balances, copy and paste the FA address you wish to verify into the search bar and hit Enter.

![Explorer 20](https://docs.factom.com/images/wallet_114.png)

The explorer displays the balance for the FA address, in this example 1.892 FCT, along with previous transactions.

![Explorer 21](https://docs.factom.com/images/wallet_115.png)

Similarly, to verify the balance of an EC address, copy and paste the EC address you wish to verify in the search bar and hit Enter.

![Explorer 22](https://docs.factom.com/images/wallet_115a.png)

Explorer displays the balance for the EC address, in this example 3999 EC, along with previous transactions.

![Explorer 23](https://docs.factom.com/images/wallet_115b.png)

### Search for a Transaction ID <a id="search-for-a-transaction-id"></a>

When sending FCT to a third party or exchange, the transaction ID is the proof that the transaction took place and that it is unique. It is important to note and keep them for your records. To search for transaction IDs, copy and paste it into the search bar and hit Enter.

![Explorer 24](https://docs.factom.com/images/wallet_116.png)

Explorer displays [details of the transaction](http://explorer.factom.org/tx/e41ebc5be64aa06cb4cdeb8d5c14ded4ae12c2a0630aa89c2fc001c086c73bdd) such as the time it was made and Inputs and Outputs. This example shows that 100 FTC were sent from the input address to the output address, with a transaction fee of 0.006 FCT debited to the sender.

![Explorer 25](https://docs.factom.com/images/wallet_117.png)

### Search for a Factom Chain <a id="search-for-a-factom-chain"></a>

Once a Factom chain is created, Explorer can provide an overview of the chain and the entries made to it. The example below shows the [Gutenberg Chain](http://explorer.factom.org/chain/00511c298668bc5032a64b76f8ede6f119add1a64482c8602966152c0b936c77), containing a few thousand entries. The Chain ID is entered into the search bar.

![Explorer 26](https://docs.factom.com/images/wallet_118.png)

Explorer returns the Project Gutenberg Chain with all its entries.

![Explorer 27](https://docs.factom.com/images/wallet_119.png)

### Search for a Block ID <a id="search-for-a-block-id"></a>

Specific blocks can be pulled up by entering the Block ID \(also known as Block Height\) into the search bar. The example below shows [block 7740](http://explorer.factom.org/dblock/d89e94a62c49efe3874745dff51e17a9fcfe486085ed2319a0a49b4463d0e9df).

![Explorer 28](https://docs.factom.com/images/wallet_120.png)

After hitting Enter, the Explorer will find the block and present its information.

![Explorer 29](https://docs.factom.com/images/wallet_121.png)  
Searching for a block is very useful particularly to look for a Block Id that was created sometime in the past, by searching for a Block Height you can go back in time in Factom very rapidly.

You are now equipped to use Factom Explorer to search the Factom Blockchain.
