# Joining the docker swarm

[![Factom protocol: Choose VPS and join the Docker Swarm](http://img.youtube.com/vi/Qghv05RCMcE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qghv05RCMcE)

This tutorial is fully covered in the video shown above.
{% endhint %}

## Installing docker

First you need to install docker. Please follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) to install docker-CE \(Community Edition\) to your system. Once it's installed run the following:

```bash
usermod -aG docker $USER
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure you logout / login again, as otherwise your current terminal session will not be updated.
{% endhint %}

## Storing the docker swarm certificate and key

Make sure you store the docker swarm main-net key and certificate on your system. The files can be found here. 

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're trying to join the test-net swarm the keys can be found [here](https://github.com/FactomProject/factomd-testnet-toolkit/tree/master/tls).
{% endhint %}

You can store these files in the directory /etc/docker for instance: 

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FactomProject/factomd-authority-toolkit/master/tls/cert.pem -O /etc/docker/factom-mainnet-cert.pem
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FactomProject/factomd-authority-toolkit/master/tls/key.pem -O /etc/docker/factom-mainnet-key.pem
sudo chmod 644 /etc/docker/factom-mainnet-cert.pem
sudo chmod 440 /etc/docker/factom-mainnet-key.pem
sudo chgrp docker /etc/docker/*.pem
```

Now you should  have the files with the correct permissions set.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note** that in the rest of this tutorial it's assumed you stored the files using the `/etc/docker` location and with the above names. If not, please adjust the commands below involving the certificate and keys.
{% endhint %}

## Configuring and running the docker engine

Configure the docker daemon using a default config file, located at `/etc/docker/daemon.json` . Create this file if it doesn't exist. Copy the following into the file:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="/etc/docker/daemon.json" %}
```bash
{
  "tls": true,
  "tlscert": "/etc/docker/factom-mainnet-cert.pem",

  "tlskey": "/etc/docker/factom-mainnet-key.pem",
  "hosts": ["tcp://0.0.0.0:2376", "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"]
}
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If your system has multiple IP addresses you can select which IP it should listen on by editing `"hosts".` 
{% endhint %}

Now you'll need to replace the standard docker start command. Run the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl edit docker.service
```

 The above command creates an override directory at `/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/` and an override file called `override.conf` \(which is open on your terminal now\).  Copy and paste the following:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="override.conf" %}
```bash
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

Exit and save the file. Now reload the docker configuration and the `docker.service`:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Docker should now be configured and ready. You can test if it runs correctly with the following:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
sudo systemctl status docker
```

It should restart with no errors appearing and you should see that the `override.conf` file has been loaded. 

## Creating the Factomd volumes

Factomd relies on two volumes, `factom_database` and `factom_keys`. Please create these before joining the swarm:

```bash
docker volume create factom_database
docker volume create factom_keys
```

These volumes are there to make sure that you can remove or delete the container itself but the database and the keys are still persistent on the system.

For running a main-net authority node we strongly recommend syncing the database from scratch. If you do already have a recently synced main-net node and would like to avoid re-syncing, run:

```bash
sudo cp -r <path to your database> /var/lib/docker/volumes/factom_database/_data .
```

The directory in \_data after the copy should be main-database, as the volume is mounted at `$HOME/.factom/m2`.

## Joining the docker swarm

Finally, to join the swarm, run the following command:

```bash
docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-5ct5plmbn1ombbjqp8ql8hq93jkof6246suzast5n1gfwa083b-1ui6w6fupe45tizz0tv6syzrs 52.48.130.243:2377
```

{% hint style="info" %}
As a reminder, joining as a worker means you have no ability to control containers on another node.
{% endhint %}

Once you have joined the network, you will be issued a control panel login by a Factom employee after messaging one of the Factom engineers on discord. You should private message the following for each node:

* NodeID \(found by running `docker info` \)
* IP address 
* Docker engine listening port \(2376\)

{% hint style="danger" %}
Only accept logins at federation.factomd.com. Any other login endpoints are fraudulent and not to be trusted.
{% endhint %}

## Starting Factomd Container from the Docker CLI

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note**: There is a version for the Factom software in the next command. Make sure you run the correct and latest announced version from the Discord \#operators-announcement channel
{% endhint %}

Run the following command _exactly:_

`docker run -d --name "factomd" -v "factom_database:/root/.factom/m2" -v "factom_keys:/root/.factom/private" -p "8088:8088" -p "8090:8090" -p "8108:8108" -l "name=factomd" factominc/factomd:v6.2.0-alpine -startdelay=600 -faulttimeout=120 -config=/root/.factom/private/factomd.conf`

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want the Factomd container to start at system boot \(reboots\) you can add the following parameter to the command above:

`--restart unless-stopped`
{% endhint %}

After this your node will be started. You can check for the existence of a Factom container using the command `docker ps` . 

You're now almost ready to be included in the main-net. Stop the `factomd` container with `docker stop factomd` and download the `factomd.conf` file [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FactomProject/factomd/master/factomd.conf). 

There are some required edits that are needed, among them you're required to enter a few special peers here. You will get more information about this if you're accepted as an ANO.

In the `important.conf` file generated earlier you'll find the following three lines:

```bash
IdentityChainID
LocalServerPrivKey
LocalServerPublicKey
```

Paste these into the `factomd.conf` and save. Now place the config file in `/var/lib/docker/volumes/factom_keys/_data`  by running \(if the file is where you're currently at\):  
  
`sudo mv factomd.conf /var/lib/docker/volumes/factom_keys/_data/factomd.conf`

Now you're free to start the `factomd` container again with `docker start factomd` . 

If you check the currently running docker containers you'll see a container named `factominc/filebeat:m3-debug` , this is generally a good sign as it means the portainer system has successfully connected and started a container remotely. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please wait for your node to be fully synced by checking the control panel node sync statuses to be 100% before performing any next steps. Please also regard the initial wait period of 20 minutes before doing anything with your node. Also note that the `factomd:v6.2.0-alpine` version may have changed since the time of writing.
